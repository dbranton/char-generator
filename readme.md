### Installation

#### Requirements
    PHP >= 5.3.7
    NodeJS
    Bower
	Grunt
	Composer

If you haven't already, you might want to make [composer be installed globally](http://andrewelkins.com/programming/php/setting-up-composer-globally-for-laravel-4/) for future ease of use.

Please note the use of the `--dev` flag.
Some packages used for ease of development are required on the development environment.

When you deploy your project on a production environment you will want to upload the ***composer.lock*** file used on the development environment and only run `php composer.phar install` on the production server.
This will skip the development packages and ensure the version of the packages installed on the production server match those you developped on.

NEVER run `php composer.phar update` on your production server.

#### Step 1: Install dependencies

    composer install --dev
    npm install
    bower install
    grunt

If you have issues using npm install use the code below

    npm install --no-bin-links

#### Step 2: Configure Environments

Laravel 4 will load configuration files depending on your environment. Basset will also build collections depending on this environment setting.

Open ***bootstrap/start.php*** and edit the following lines to match your settings. You want to be using your machine name in Windows and your hostname in OS X and Linux (type `hostname` in terminal). Using the machine name will allow the `php artisan` command to use the right configuration files as well.

    $env = $app->detectEnvironment(array(

        'local' => array('your-local-machine-name'),
        'staging' => array('your-staging-machine-name'),
        'production' => array('your-production-machine-name'),

    ));

Now create the folder inside ***app/config*** that corresponds to the environment the code is deployed in. This will most likely be ***local*** when you first start a project.

You will now be copying the initial configuration file inside this folder before editing it. Let's start with ***app/config/app.php***. So ***app/config/local/app.php*** will probably look something like this, as the rest of the configuration can be left to their defaults from the initial config file:

    <?php

    return array(

        'url' => 'http://myproject.local',

        'timezone' => 'UTC',

        'key' => 'YourSecretKey!!!',

        'providers' => array(

        [... Removed ...]

        /* Uncomment for use in development */
    //     'Way\Generators\GeneratorsServiceProvider', // Generators
    //     'Barryvdh\LaravelIdeHelper\IdeHelperServiceProvider', // IDE Helpers

        ),

    );

#### Step 3: Configure Database

Now that you have the environment configured, you need to create a database configuration for it. Copy the file ***app/config/database.php*** in ***app/config/local*** and edit it to match your local database settings. You can remove all the parts that you have not changed as this configuration file will be loaded over the initial one.

#### Step 4: Configure Mailer

In the same fashion, copy the ***app/config/mail.php*** configuration file in ***app/config/local/mail.php***. Now set the `address` and `name` from the `from` array in ***config/mail.php***. Those will be used to send account confirmation and password reset emails to the users.
If you don't set that registration will fail because it cannot send the confirmation email.

#### Step 5: Populate Database
Run these commands to create and populate Users table:

	php artisan migrate
	php artisan db:seed

#### Step 6: Make sure app/storage is writable by your web server.

If permissions are set correctly:

    chmod -R 775 app/storage

Should work, if not try

    chmod -R 777 app/storage
